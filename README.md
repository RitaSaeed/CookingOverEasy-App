# DevProject
Profile: Cooking Over Easy (Rita Saeed, Tyler Chitwood, Skyla Lloyd, Karen Jank)

Project Scope: An application that is designed to provide assistance to users looking for help in their culinary journey. This application will include an organized grocery list, a recipe search function, a saved recipes function, and the ability for users to input their own recipes. The application will at present only function on mobile devices running Android, including phones and tablets. It will consist of multiple menus that the user will be able to navigate through using a persistent navigation bar located at the bottom of the screen. 

Projected Sprint Development Plan:
- Sprint 1: user can modify app settings, user can change preferences, system has solid structure and easy layout, splash screen and welcome screen to greet new users, found API, designed mockups, created project in android studio, login credentials, create account function
- Sprint 2: system can make request to ingredients and recipe APIs and output data, user can search for recipes, user can filter search and create/store saved recipes in personal CookBook
- Sprint 3: user can add/remove items to grocery list, user can organize grocery list into categories, user can create/modify recipes

Tech Stack Information:
We are using Java, Firebase, MySQL, and Android Studio

Deployment Instructions: 
When we finish the app, we'll test and push any final changes to git. We'll make sure code is consistent througout all team members and that there are no conflicts during testing. 


## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Already a pro? Just edit this README.md and make it your own. Want to make it easy? [Use the template at the bottom](#editing-this-readme)!

## Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/ru-itec/tlewis-williams/s23-itec370/team01/dev.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Integrate with your tools

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Cooking Over Easy

## Description
Cooking Over Easy is an android application. The main point of this app is to create and discover recipes as well as generate a grocery list built from the saved recipes that can be added to and removes from. The app will allow users to create and save account information upon first download and the user will remained logged in until logging out. Users will be able to set diet and protein preferences within the app so specific recipes that meet the clients requests can be suggested.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
To download and run this app, you must download android studio to your computer. Once android studio is downloaded, you can clone our GitLab repository to your device. Once the project is cloned, you can go into android studio, select file, and then open. Open will allow you to open a project from your repository. When you open the project, you will need an emulator to run the application. You can download the emulator by selecting the device manager and then create device. We recommend using the Google Pixel 6, v.Tiramisu, API 33 as this is the devide we have used most frequently to develope the app. If you would like to download the application to an android device, you can plug your android device into your computer, and allow access. Once the device is plugged in, the device should appear in your device manager. Hit the run button, and the app should be downloaded onto your device permantly until deleted, even when the device in unplugged.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
